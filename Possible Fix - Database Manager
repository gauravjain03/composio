To solve the issue of adding a new local tool—a **Database Manager**—I will guide you on how to implement the tool in your codebase. This Database Manager will allow users to connect to a database, execute SQL commands, and disconnect from the database.

Solution Overview:
1. Connect to a Database: This function will accept database credentials and return a connection ID.
2. Execute a Command: This function will take the connection ID, SQL command, and a timeout as inputs, execute the command, and return the output.
3. Disconnect: This function will disconnect from the database using the connection ID.

### Steps to Implement the Database Manager

1. **Create a `DatabaseManager` class** that handles all the above-mentioned actions.

### Code Implementation

#### 1. **Creating the `DatabaseManager` Class**

```python
import sqlite3
from typing import Dict, Any

class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connections = {}  # Store connection IDs with connection objects
    
    def connect_to_db(self, db_path: str) -> str:
        """
        Connect to the database and return a connection ID.
        
        :param db_path: Path to the database file.
        :return: Connection ID (unique string)
        """
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        conn_id = str(id(conn))  # Create a unique ID based on the connection object.
        self.connections[conn_id] = conn
        return conn_id

    def execute_command(self, conn_id: str, sql_command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Execute an SQL command and return the result or error.
        
        :param conn_id: The ID of the connection.
        :param sql_command: The SQL command to execute.
        :param timeout: The maximum time allowed for executing the command.
        :return: A dictionary containing the result or error.
        """
        if conn_id not in self.connections:
            return {"error": "Invalid connection ID"}
        
        conn = self.connections[conn_id]
        conn.set_timeout(timeout)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        try:
            cursor.execute(sql_command)
            conn.commit()  # Commit if it's a write operation.
            result = cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch the results for read operations.
            return {"result": result}
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            return {"error": str(e)}
    
    def disconnect(self, conn_id: str) -> str:
        """
        Disconnect from the database using the connection ID.
        
        :param conn_id: The ID of the connection.
        :return: Success message or error if connection ID is invalid.
        """
        if conn_id in self.connections:
            conn = self.connections.pop(conn_id)
            conn.close()
            return f"Connection {conn_id} closed successfully."
        else:
            return "Invalid connection ID."
```

#### 2. **Explaining the Key Components:**

- **`connect_to_db`**: Connects to the database using a provided path (`db_path`) and returns a unique connection ID. The connection is stored in the `self.connections` dictionary, where each ID maps to its connection object.
- **`execute_command`**: Executes an SQL command using the connection ID. It checks for valid connection IDs, executes the SQL command, and returns the result or an error. It allows for a timeout, which can be adjusted.
- **`disconnect`**: Disconnects from the database and removes the connection from the dictionary based on the connection ID.

### 3. **Unit Testing the Database Manager**

To ensure your changes work as expected, create unit tests to test connecting, executing commands, and disconnecting from the database.

```python
import unittest

class TestDatabaseManager(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.db_manager = DatabaseManager()
        self.db_path = ":memory:"  # Use an in-memory database for testing.
    
    def test_connect_to_db(self):
        conn_id = self.db_manager.connect_to_db(self.db_path)
        self.assertTrue(conn_id in self.db_manager.connections)

    def test_execute_command(self):
        conn_id = self.db_manager.connect_to_db(self.db_path)
        create_table_cmd = "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)"
        result = self.db_manager.execute_command(conn_id, create_table_cmd)
        self.assertEqual(result, {"result": []})  # No result expected for a create table command.

    def test_disconnect(self):
        conn_id = self.db_manager.connect_to_db(self.db_path)
        msg = self.db_manager.disconnect(conn_id)
        self.assertEqual(msg, f"Connection {conn_id} closed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 4. **Changes to Make in Your Files**

#### **New File: `tools/database_manager.py`**
This file will contain the `DatabaseManager` class as defined above.

#### **Changes to `contributing.md`:**
Add a section that describes how contributors can extend the `DatabaseManager` or work on similar local tools for database-related functionalities.

#### **Usage Example:**

```python
from tools.database_manager import DatabaseManager

# Initialize DatabaseManager
db_manager = DatabaseManager()

# Connect to a SQLite database
conn_id = db_manager.connect_to_db("test.db")

# Execute SQL command
result = db_manager.execute_command(conn_id, "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
print(result)

# Disconnect
msg = db_manager.disconnect(conn_id)
print(msg)
```
